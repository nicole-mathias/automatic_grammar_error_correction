# Lightweight Deployment Guide

## Overview

This lightweight version uses base models instead of trained models to avoid the 4GB deployment limit. The app will work immediately but with limited accuracy.

## Features

- **Base T5 Model**: For grammar correction (limited capability)
- **Base DistilBERT Model**: For error detection (limited capability)
- **Multilingual Support**: UI supports all languages but uses base model
- **Small Size**: ~500MB total vs 3.3GB for trained models

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub

The lightweight version is already configured. Just push the changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add lightweight deployment version"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Railway

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. Choose your repository
6. Railway will automatically deploy using `app_lightweight.py`

### 3. No Environment Variables Needed

The lightweight version doesn't need any environment variables since it uses base models.

## Performance Expectations

### Base Models vs Trained Models

| Feature | Base Models | Trained Models |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Error Detection** | Limited accuracy | High accuracy |
| **Grammar Correction** | Basic corrections | Advanced corrections |
| **Model Size** | ~500MB | ~3.3GB |
| **Deployment** | ✅ Works on free tier | ❌ Exceeds 4GB limit |

### What to Expect

- **Error Detection**: Will work but may not catch all errors
- **Grammar Correction**: Will make basic corrections but not as accurate
- **Speed**: Faster startup and inference
- **Reliability**: More stable deployment

## Future Upgrades

Once deployed successfully, you can:

1. **Upgrade to Paid Plan**: Railway offers larger storage for paid plans
2. **Use Model Hosting**: Host models on Hugging Face or other services
3. **Implement Progressive Loading**: Download trained models on-demand

## Testing Locally

Test the lightweight version locally:

```bash
python app_lightweight.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:5002` to test the interface.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model Loading Errors**: Base models should load reliably
2. **Memory Issues**: Base models use much less memory
3. **Timeout Errors**: Reduced timeout to 300 seconds

### Logs

Check Railway logs for any errors:
- Model loading status
- API endpoint responses
- Memory usage

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. **Test the Interface**: Verify all features work
2. **Monitor Performance**: Check response times
3. **Consider Upgrades**: Plan for trained model integration
4. **User Feedback**: Gather feedback on base model performance

## Alternative: Hybrid Approach

For better performance, consider:

1. **Start with Base Models**: Deploy lightweight version
2. **Add Model Download**: Implement on-demand model loading
3. **Caching**: Cache downloaded models for faster access
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Gradually improve accuracy

This approach gives you a working deployment immediately while planning for improvements.
